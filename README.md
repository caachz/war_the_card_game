# War or Peace the Card Game

This is a personal project to build my own skills and understanding of the Java programming language. 

This game has two players already input into the system. Once the game has begun both players will continue to play until either there is a winner or a draw.

## Key Learnings
My learning goal in this project was to understand the fundementals of Java programming. 
  * I learned what an integrated evelopent environment was and how to use it.
  * I learned how to use a statically typed language.
    * One example was when I needed to declare not only the type of object the Array itself was but also the type of objects it would hold. 
  * I learned what the main method is and how to use it in a development environment. 

## To set this up locally

* clone down this repo onto your local computer
* open the project in the integrated development environment of your choice.  
  * I used IntelliJ IDEA for development.
* Run the main method
* This will prompt you in the terminal to either start the game or exit. 
  * Enter 'GO' to start
* This will commence the game until there is either a winner or a draw.
